Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project repository! This project is dedicated to various Natural Language Processing tasks using Python.

## Overview
Natural Language Processing involves the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to understand and process human language. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for various NLP tasks implemented in Python.

## Key Features
- **Text Classification:** Implementing classifiers for various text categories.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment of textual content.
- **Language Translation:** Building models for language translation tasks.
- **Speech Recognition:** Processing and recognizing spoken language.
