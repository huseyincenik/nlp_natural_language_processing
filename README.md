Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project repository! This project is dedicated to various Natural Language Processing tasks using Python.

## Overview
Natural Language Processing involves the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to understand and process human language. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for various NLP tasks implemented in Python.

## Key Features
- **Text Classification:** Implementing classifiers for various text categories.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the sentiment of textual content.
- **Language Translation:** Building models for language translation tasks.
- **Speech Recognition:** Processing and recognizing spoken language.

| Sentiment Analysis: Predicting Product Recommendations via Text Analysis | This project focuses on sentiment analysis to predict product recommendations through advanced text analysis techniques. Explore various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models for accurate predictions. | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/huseyincenik/sentiment-analysis-predicting-product-recommends) | [GitHub](https://github.com/huseyincenik/nlp_natural_language_processing/tree/main/sentiment_analysis_predicting_product_recommendations_via_text_analysis) |
| Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews | This project explores various pre-trained models for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. By leveraging Kaggle's TPU, I trained BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNet, GPT, BART, MobileBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA models, each for a maximum of 2 epochs to prevent overfitting. | [Kaggle Notebook 1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/huseyincenik/transformers-for-sentiment-classification-1) [Kaggle Notebook 2](https://www.kaggle.com/code/huseyincenik/transformers-for-sentiment-classification-2) | [GitHub](https://github.com/huseyincenik/nlp_natural_language_processing/tree/main/projects/transformers_for_sentiment_classification) |
