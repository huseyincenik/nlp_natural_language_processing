# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews with Pre-Trained Models

![image](https://github.com/huseyincenik/nlp_natural_language_processing/blob/main/projects/transformers_for_sentiment_classification/images/compare_final.png)

This project explores various pre-trained models for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. By leveraging Kaggle's TPU, I trained BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNet, GPT, BART, MobileBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA models, each for a maximum of 2 epochs to prevent overfitting.

## Highlights:
- According to observations from the first notebook, RoBERTa model ranked 1st in terms of Recall, F1 Score and XLNet model ranked 1st in terms of Average Precision Score</span>. Here, the RoBERTa model stood out more compared to other models.
- According to observations from the first and second notebook, MobileBERT model ranked 1st in terms of Recall, RoBERTa model ranked 1st in terms of F1 Score and ELECTRA model ranked 1st in terms of Average Precision Score. Here, the ELECTRA model stood out more compared to other models.
