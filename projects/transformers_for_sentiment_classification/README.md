# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews with Pre-Trained Models

![image](https://github.com/huseyincenik/nlp_natural_language_processing/assets/127469334/39a9c1cc-a6bb-42a8-a245-c1a7c7bc018f)

This project explores various pre-trained models for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. By leveraging Kaggle's TPU, I trained BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, XLNet, GPT, BART, MobileBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA models, each for a maximum of 2 epochs to prevent overfitting.

## Highlights:
- RoBERTa model ranked 1st in Recall, F1 Score, and Average Precision Score in the first notebook.
- ELECTRA model outperformed all other models in the second notebook, achieving the highest scores across all metrics.

Check out the notebooks for detailed analysis and comparisons between different models!
