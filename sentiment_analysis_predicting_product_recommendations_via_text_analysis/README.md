## Overview
This project revolves around employing sentiment analysis techniques to determine whether a product is recommended or not. Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost, deep learning, and BERT, were implemented to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Women's Clothing Reviews, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews).
